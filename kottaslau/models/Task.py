    Attributes
    ----------
    task_id : str
        task's unique id
    m : float
        mean of the task's execution time (time unit coherent with other parameters, e.g. minutes)
    s : float
        variance of the task's execution time (time unit coherent with other parameters, e.g. minutes)
    out_line_cost : float
        task's completition cost outside the assembly line (in general, higher than the in-line cost) [â‚¬/pc]
    predecessor_set : Set[str]
        set of tasks that to complete before the task (with a direct relation in the operation process chart)
    out_completion_cost : float
        completition cost outside the assembly line of the task and all the following tasks (according with the operation process chart)
    in_line_cost : float
        task's completition cost in a station (computed from mean execution time and the station cost)
    z_limit : float
        task's normalized execution time limit that solves: inline_cost = out_completion_cost*P with P the probability of missed complition of the task
    n_successors : int
        number of tasks that depend on the task according with the operation process chart
